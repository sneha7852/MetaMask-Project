# MetaMask-Project

## üöÄ Overview
This project showcases hands-on experience with blockchain technology by creating and managing decentralized wallets using **MetaMask** and **Trust Wallet**. It involves working on the **Sepolia TestNet** to explore Web3 capabilities, including sending and receiving cryptocurrencies, executing transactions, and interacting with Decentralized Applications (DApps). 

By completing this project, I have gained valuable insights into the core aspects of blockchain technology, decentralized wallets, and the Web3 ecosystem.

## üìë Key Steps
1. **Installing MetaMask/Trust Wallet**:
   - MetaMask extension was installed on the browser, and a wallet was created by securely storing the seed phrase.
   - Trust Wallet was explored as a mobile alternative for wallet management.

2. **Enabling Test Networks**:
   - The Sepolia TestNet was activated in MetaMask, enabling test ETH transactions.

3. **Adding Test ETH**:
   - Test ETH was added to the wallet via a faucet for experimentation.

4. **Transaction Execution**:
   - Sent and received test ETH between accounts to understand blockchain transactions.

5. **Connecting to a DApp**:
   - The MetaMask wallet was connected to **Uniswap** to demonstrate real-time token swaps and blockchain interactions.
